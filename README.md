## Introduction
For our group project we decided to do an analysis on the Texas ERCOT power grid: our null hypothesis is to prove why Texas’ independent power grid (ERCOT) is reliable and performs to acceptable levels based on its responses with the black outs rates, price averages, and energy usage.  
## Team members
Our Team members consist of  Loraine who will go over ERCOT’s history, I personally will be going over the evaluation on energy consumption, Ariana will discuss cost comparison, Paul will touch on power grids strains, and Kristal will cover the winter freeze response. 
## ERCOT and Shared grids
Right now Texas current power grid is ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) this power grid has failed their residents numerous times. Which is why Our goal is to convince Texans to be in support of leaving this faulty grid and join a shared power grid such as the Eastern or  Western interconnection grids. To achieve this goal we will employ data regarding power outages, electricity consumption, historical temperatures and average cost. 

I will now be giving a quick breakdown of the US national power grid and how it is divided,
 As you can see from the map to the right the united states is divided into three power grids you have Ercot which is at the bottom of the map filled in green.

ERCOT is an independent system operator that manages the flow of electric power in the state of texas, it covers about 90 percent of the state's electric load, its scheduled electric power grid connects more than 52,700 miles of transmission lines and has 1,030 generation plus units.
Next you have the on the left side colored in red the.

Western Interconnection power grid:this grid Stretches from Western Canada, to  parts of Mexico,and reaches eastward over the Rocky mountains to the Great Plains. All of the electric utilities in the Western Interconnection are electrically tied together during normal system conditions and operate at a synchronized frequency.

Lastly  you have the eastern interconnection which is the right side colored in blue  the …

Eastern Interconnection power grid:  Reaches from Central Canada eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Quebec), then goes south to Florida, and back to the western Great Plains (excluding most of Texas). This grid is similar to the western interconnection because   All of the electric utilities in this power grid are electrically tied together during normal system conditions and operate at a synchronized frequency as well.

## History Of Texas Power Gri
 The US is divided into three interconnections: Eastern, Western, and ERCOT. 

Texas is unique when it comes to their interconnection, it operates its own system with full regulatory authority and responsibility for generation and transmission.Going back to 1907, electricity was seen as an essential service. Since it’s seen as a necessity, states have  decided to regulate power companies. This regulation allowed the state to tell power companies where they can operate and how much they can charge for electric service. This provided fairness to customers and placed a limit on monopolies.

Moreover,  most states made the decision to regulate local energy companies. 
But Texas was not one of them. Texas power companies came together and shared power for the first time, creating our electric grid as we know it.Between the years of 1933- 1939, President Franklin D Roosevelt aimed to provide economic relief and reforms to stabilize the economy through his NEW DEAL. In 1935, Franklin signed the Public Utility Holding Company Act. 

This Act allows the federal government to regulate and break up Large energy companies, but the regulation can ONLY be implemented if power companies were buying or selling electricity to another state. Thus, Texas avoided this law by remaining to operate within its own state. . . 
Texas was not the only state to have thought of avoiding this law. Other states wanted to take advantage of this as well, but failed because they could not generate enough energy to reliably serve their own people. Texas has the capability due to its size and two different time zones. The benefit of two different time zones is different peak demands. The different peak hours help produce the required demand of energy for Texas residents.

In present day, Texas is still operating its own power grid. The grid is called EROCT, it ran by an agency of the same name Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which covers 90% of the states power.

Now Paul is going to talk about the Power Grid Strains

## Six/Summer weather grid strains

In places with warmer climates, such as Texas, peak demand for electricity often happens in summer.  This is caused by wide-spread use of air conditioning, which is a large fraction of home energy usage and coincides with the time that most people are awake and using power for other purposes.  For example, yesterday, according to ERCOT’s online dashboard, the minimum power usage was around 48.5 GW a bit before 5 am, while the maximum power usage amounted to over 74 gigawatts at around 4 pm as shown on the graph.  Peak demand was about 52% higher than minimum demand, just on the same day.Traditionally, electric companies have handled this by building enough electrical generation capacity for what they estimate peak usage to be.  This can get pretty expensive, as each megawatt produced by the power companies costs more to produce than the last, and there are significant costs associated with turning on a power plant when it is offline.  Additionally, there are costs associated with building power generation that only gets used a few times per year and that doesn’t generate revenue most of the time.  All of these costs tend to be passed on to consumers of electricity. 

The opposite approach is to try to decrease peak demand to match the amount of electrical power generated.  This approach is called demand response.  One way that power companies try to control demand is by charging more for power consumed at particular times, such as summer afternoons through the use of smart meters, which send electrical usage data back to the utility company at frequent intervals, much to the concern of privacy advocates.  Most people, however, are not very price sensitive when it comes to electrical usage—people are going to cool their homes when it’s hot out.  Power companies can make deals with businesses to cut power usage at key times in exchange for compensation, but that has not produced enough savings to reduce demand enough for the electrical companies.  The power companies have therefore started programs to reduce energy consumption by homeowners by remotely increasing the temperature on people’s wifi-enabled thermostats during times of increased demand.  While utility companies insist that participation in these programs is voluntary and opt-in, many people have been surprised to find their homes considerably warmer than expected.  According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, tens of thousands of electrical customers are enrolled in such programs, and, as of July 19, power companies had increased their customers’ thermostat temperatures 14 times this year, compared to 15 times in a typical year.  That average is likely to increase as the global climate warms.

Kristal will be talking about the winter freeze.

## Blackouts/Winter Freeze

For many Texans the winter freeze was a wake up call that showed everyone how unchecked ERCOT is

So what was the winter freeze?
Well in February of 2021, Texas was hit with an unprecedented winter storm that devastated the entire state. This storm was called winter storm Uri and in her wake, it is estimated that around 70% of Texans felt effects in some way. Many were left without necessities such power, water, and food. Now, ERCOT was told by weather specialists to start preparing for freezing conditions on february 11th, but it wasn’t until the 14th that the ERCOT energy grid started failing. By this time the demand for electricity was going up as everyone was staying at home and using their heaters and it was on this day they implemented rolling blackouts. These blackouts are when the company purposely turns off power in a specific area in order to preserve the electrical grid. Later, after the event, an ERCOT official said that the Texas power grid was "seconds or minutes away from" complete failure when partial grid shutdowns were implemented.

You might be telling yourself, well it is a bit understandable that all these unfortunate problems would happen considering the circumstances. But this is not the case. Take Oklahoma for example, they were hit with the same storm as we were, in fact in some areas they faced worse temperatures than us, some going as low as -15 degrees. However, they did not experience anywhere near the same amount of blackouts. In fact while more than 5 million texas electricity customers faced some type of blackout only around 300,000 oklahoma electricity customers dealt with unintentional blackouts (unintentional meaning that they did not have to deal with rolling blackouts)

After all this the question arose, how did this happen, especially if Texas is one of the nation’s top producers of energy? With them being able to draw from resources such as wind, natural gas, and coal. There were a few reasons as to why ERCOT’s power grid failed. But the main reason being ERCOT failed to winterize their energy sources, specifically their wind turbines and natural gas infrastructure. This error alone caused more than 50% of the grid failure. In fact back in 2011 ERCOT was warned by U.S Federal Regulators that their grid would fail when faced with extreme weather conditions, however since ERCOT is unregulated the warning went unheard. 

Now Jasmine is going to talk about energy consumption 

## Energy Consumption

The  Energy consumption Evaluation Is based off of the amount of energy used in 2020 for TX, OK, and NM

I decided to compare texas to both shared grids, for the western interconnection example I decided to compare New mexico to Texas based on energy consumption that tracked the states energy use for commercial and residential power usage.  off of the data I analyzed I was able to determine that new mexico's energy consumption showed a significant difference in the amount of btu saved compared to texas. 

Now in the easterm interconnection you will see a similar trend in energy consumption when comparing ok to texas, this data showed a slight increase in the amount of btu used compared to new mexico however there is still a substantial difference in the total energy consumed vs texas. Which has a direct impact on cost and outages.

Ariana will now be go over the cost comparison

## Cost Comparison

Here we are comparing the total monthly energy bills for Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The reason we chose Arizona and New Mexico is because Arizona and New Mexico have similar weather conditions and temperatures to Texas.  As you can see the total energy cost for Texas is $416 and monthly electricity cost is $154. For New Mexico the total energy cost is $377, and the monthly electricity cost is $99. And for Arizona the total energy cost is $403, and the monthly electricity cost is $150. The total energy cost does include the cost for electricity, natural gas, motor fuel and home heating oil. So, in Texas as you can see, our cost for Energy and Electricity is more expensive. 

 We did break down the average electricity bills by state and city for this year. We chose 6 cities in each Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. We chose Oklahoma for this because Oklahoma has similar weather conditions as north Texas does. For Texas we chose Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Lubbock, and Midland. Based on ERCOT data for these 6 cities the average household uses about 1490 kilowatts per hour and the average cost for the kilowatts per hour is 12¢, which makes the monthly electricity bill about $184/month. For Oklahoma we chose Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman, Broken Arrow, Edmond, and Lawton. Based on EIA data for these 6 cities the average household uses about 797 kilowatts per hour and the average cost for the kilowatts per hour is 14¢, which makes the monthly electricity bill about $111 / month. For New Mexico we chose Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Rio Rancho, Santa Fe, Roswell, and Farmington.  Based on EIA data for these 6 cities the average household uses about 1430 kilowatts per hour and the average cost for the kilowatts per hour is 13¢, which makes the monthly electricity bill about $160 / month. This data shows that we as Texans pay more on average per month compared to our neighboring states and by switching to the national grid our prices for electricity would decrease. 


## SConclusion
So, in the beginning we started by wanting to disprove the idea that ERCOT is reliable and performs to acceptable levels based on price averages, energy usage, and black out rates. During our analysis we showed how ERCOT regulates homeowners' thermostats, denies people electricity when they need it the most and takes advantage of customers by charging higher electricity bills than the states surrounding us. All of these things highlight the true extent of how ERCOT has been abusing their freedom that they gained by being independent from the rest of the country. It is time that Texas joins the US national power grid and allows Texans the opportunity to get fair and reliable energy.

## Potential Questions:
-How would you propose Texas go to the main grid?
	-The logistics would probably have to be arranged between texas and EIA officials, but the idea would be that, the us power grid representatives would come in and do a whole over haul of our system. Evaluate what can be used/replaced and connect our current system to the main. Basically we want the same quality control as the rest of the country, and we want people to be held accountable for the types of problems that we mentioned. As things are right now there are no checks and balances with ERCOT considering they essentially have the monopoly on texas energy. However the specifics would probably need to be sorted out via professionals

-What was your null hypothesis?
	-Null Hypothesis: Texas’ independent power grid (ERCOT) is reliable and performs to acceptable levels based on its responses with the black outs rates, price averages, and energy usage.

-How/where did you guys get your information?
	-alot of our information was found via official .gov websites in huge data dumps. Most notably ercot’s website and eia.gov (which is the country’s power grid website) and we mostly pulled like large csv files that we cleaned up and sorted through. We wanted to use datasets like openweather and read in the data from the api keys, but we needed more historic data, and most of that information was locked behind a paywall. So it was a lot of cleaning csv files.
