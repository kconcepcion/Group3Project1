##Project Description/Outline 
###Intro - Right now Texans rely too heavily on the ERCOT power grid that has failed them too many times. Our goal is to convince Texans to be in support of leaving this faulty grid and join the US National power grid. To achieve this goal we will employ data regarding power outages, electricity usage, historical temperatures and average cost. 
We will provide some background to explain why texas is separate from the rest of the country 
Show that the areas we are comparing have similar temperature stats
Explain what a rolling blackout is
We will also include a short description summarizing our dataâ€™s limitations
###Conclusion - After reviewing data we provided it is clear to see how unstable the ERCOT power grid is and how it has failed Texans.
##Research Questions to Answer 
Will temperatures continue to rise as time goes on? (thereby meeting ercots standards for more energy regulation)
What types of cities/areas had longer/more frequently rolling blackouts?
When did these blackouts start occuring? And how often do they take place?
When does ERCOT start regulating our thermostats?  
(comparing between two states)
Comparing average electricity cost to neighboring states
Comparing average usage
Comparing Energy consumption between major/rural
Comparing frequency of black outs between major and rural
Datasets to Be Used 
Tbd
Visuals used
Scatterplot w/ linear regression (to predict temperatures)
Scatterplot w/ linear regression (to predict energy consumption)
Pie chart to show the difference of energy consumption between major/rural cities
Bar graph
major cities and their black out times
Cost of average electricity bill as time goes on
Bar chart for monthly expenses to showcase seasons
Rough Breakdown of Tasks
Compile data
Sort through and analyze data
Form conclusions and final summary
Create final presentation
